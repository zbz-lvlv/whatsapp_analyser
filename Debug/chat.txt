8/8/17, 23:27:58: Wan Xi: you know, sometimes when people have a crush, they start talking to everyone so that when they talk to their crush, it seems very normal
8/8/17, 23:28:01: Wan Xi: and not out of place
8/8/17, 23:28:23: Wan Xi: i dont like coffee :o

Hi Wan Xi, check out the video of my magic app's performance.

Feeling really good after many months of work
12/8/17, 22:29:32: Wan Xi: oooooohhhh
12/8/17, 22:29:33: Wan Xi: okieee!!!
12/8/17, 22:36:43: Wan Xi: :D
12/8/17, 22:36:45: Wan Xi: natalia!!!
12/8/17, 22:36:46: Wan Xi: :D
12/8/17, 22:36:48: Wan Xi: she looks pretty
12/8/17, 22:36:53: Bozheng: Yup
12/8/17, 22:37:04: Wan Xi: just wondering though
12/8/17, 22:37:07: Bozheng: Hongyu invited her to film with us
12/8/17, 22:37:24: Wan Xi: does natalia know how the app works?
12/8/17, 22:37:45: Wan Xi: like is natalia playing the role of someone who doesnt know anything
12/8/17, 22:37:47: Bozheng: Sort of, but she can't really replicate it
12/8/17, 22:38:02: Wan Xi: or are the two of them putting on a show for others?
12/8/17, 22:38:07: Bozheng: Yup that's her role
12/8/17, 22:38:17: Bozheng: It's to promote the app so that ppl will buy
12/8/17, 22:38:43: Bozheng: And got her to dress up nice and put on a bit of makeup
12/8/17, 22:39:23: Wan Xi: as innn, can a random idiot who doesnt know anything do what natalia does in the video? :o
12/8/17, 22:40:02: Bozheng: Actually that will create a more authentic reaction
12/8/17, 22:40:04: Wan Xi: IM NOT ASKING THIS PROPERLY
12/8/17, 22:40:04: Wan Xi: ;-;
12/8/17, 22:40:33: Wan Xi: hmm?
12/8/17, 22:40:40: Wan Xi: nono nvm haha
12/8/17, 22:40:49: Wan Xi: i cant seem to express what i mean
12/8/17, 22:41:42: Bozheng: Happens to me as well. Can be really frustrating, you want to say something but just don't know how to put in in words and you just want to scream
12/8/17, 22:41:55: Wan Xi: so
12/8/17, 22:42:14: Wan Xi: any place where i can chip in
12/8/17, 22:42:15: Wan Xi: :>
12/8/17, 22:42:22: Wan Xi: like
12/8/17, 22:42:24: Wan Xi: spread
12/8/17, 22:42:31: Wan Xi: or comment smth
12/8/17, 22:43:48: Bozheng: Actually it's fine. It's targeted towards professionals and magic amateurs
12/8/17, 22:44:16: Bozheng: So mindless spreading on social media is kinda not really effective
12/8/17, 22:44:47: Wan Xi: okay
12/8/17, 22:45:19: Bozheng: So what you did today
12/8/17, 22:45:49: Wan Xi: science research
12/8/17, 22:45:50: Wan Xi: hehe
12/8/17, 22:46:06: Wan Xi: ahh but seriously
12/8/17, 22:46:15: Wan Xi: that video is so inspiring
12/8/17, 22:46:34: Wan Xi: did you just finish it today?
12/8/17, 22:46:59: Bozheng: Hong yu just found the music a few hours ago
12/8/17, 22:47:30: Wan Xi: do you plan on varying the music though? :o

22/8/17, 18:26:23: Wan Xi: 😂
22/8/17, 18:26:35: Bozheng: I spent most of my effort trying to follow the steps instead of enjoyinf the dance
22/8/17, 18:26:47: Bozheng: Orientation. The one in Feb
22/8/17, 18:27:00: Wan Xi: Igl is not orientation though

22/8/17, 18:28:41: Wan Xi: Oooooooohhh

29/8/17, 22:14:58: Wan Xi: Small and open is smth like sg's economy right?
29/8/17, 22:15:40: Wan Xi: Domestic consumption would be far more significant for a large and less open econony
29/8/17, 22:16:13: Bozheng: Isnt that related to imports? Increase in imports leads to decrease in domestic consumptions

8/9/17, 23:07:10: Bozheng: How it feels like for a live crab in a steam pot

23/9/17, 18:49:29: Bozheng: Anyway how does your family celebrate this kind of traditional festivals like mid autumn
23/9/17, 20:14:36: Wan Xi: yeah, not on the moon
23/9/17, 20:14:44: Wan Xi: but your house seems like a good place to start
23/9/17, 20:14:44: Wan Xi: :3
23/9/17, 20:14:53: Wan Xi: i heard it's on the first floor
23/9/17, 20:15:00: Wan Xi: dont leave your kitchen windows open

23/9/17, 20:15:39: Wan Xi: festivals are just about food

23/9/17, 20:15:50: Wan Xi: buying
23/9/17, 20:15:52: Wan Xi: eating

23/9/17, 20:24:22: Bozheng: The moon cake is not in the kitchen
23/9/17, 20:24:33: Bozheng: It's hidden in an undisclosed location
23/9/17, 20:24:57: Bozheng: And dont worry it's not hidden in one of my drawers or under my bed
23/9/17, 20:26:09: Bozheng: The order of these 3 doesn't look correct, eh?
23/9/17, 22:27:23: Wan Xi: :c
23/9/17, 22:28:24: Wan Xi: Hmmm for you to give it so much security...
23/9/17, 22:28:29: Wan Xi: It must be good mooncakes
23/9/17, 22:28:38: Wan Xi: ☺☺☺
23/9/17, 22:29:02: Wan Xi: Why? :o first you try being a good citizen and get it the legal way
23/9/17, 22:29:15: Wan Xi: Then you enjoy it
23/9/17, 22:30:09: Wan Xi: After that youre too lazy and cant be bothered and your marginal benefit decreases (law of dimishing utility) so you arent willing to pay for it
23/9/17, 22:30:13: Wan Xi: So you steal it c:
23/9/17, 22:30:51: Wan Xi: Have you tried mooncake making before?
23/9/17, 22:30:55: Wan Xi: It's really special
23/9/17, 22:31:19: Wan Xi: _ohh?_ you arent asleep yet
23/9/17, 22:31:23: Wan Xi: Tsk tsk
23/9/17, 22:31:40: Bozheng: Making mooncakes? There's such activity in my primary school
23/9/17, 22:31:53: Bozheng: I remember making the 冰皮月饼
23/9/17, 22:32:04: Wan Xi: YES
23/9/17, 22:32:11: Wan Xi: I MADE THAT TOO IN SECONDARY SCHOOL
23/9/17, 22:32:15: Wan Xi: Along with tea appreciation
23/9/17, 22:32:24: Bozheng: It's 10:30pm on a saturday night
23/9/17, 22:32:24: Wan Xi: 😍😍😍
23/9/17, 22:32:34: Wan Xi: Aka sleep time
23/9/17, 22:32:41: Bozheng: I get that every weekend
23/9/17, 22:32:46: Bozheng: My mum will make tea
23/9/17, 22:32:47: Wan Xi: Am i right or am i right
23/9/17, 22:33:17: Wan Xi: It's difffereeentttttttttt
23/9/17, 22:33:31: Wan Xi: Going to a teahouse with your friends
23/9/17, 22:33:40: Wan Xi: And trying to do it like the pros
23/9/17, 22:34:15: Wan Xi: With all the elegance(cough), flair(cough) and sophistication (coughs agaib) we could possibly muster
23/9/17, 22:34:30: Wan Xi: Pouring tea and failing miserably
23/9/17, 22:34:35: Bozheng: My mum will teach me how to enjoy a cup of tea, like the importance of smelling the cup after drinking
23/9/17, 22:34:52: Wan Xi: Mmmm
23/9/17, 22:34:58: Wan Xi: Yeah we were taught that too haha
23/9/17, 22:35:04: Wan Xi: Does it actually work for you? :o
23/9/17, 22:35:18: Wan Xi: I dont really have a very good sense of smell i dont really feel the difference
23/9/17, 22:35:20: Wan Xi: :/
23/9/17, 22:35:40: Bozheng: It actually does smell nice
23/9/17, 22:35:48: Bozheng: Especially high quality tea
23/9/17, 22:35:56: Wan Xi: Mhmmm yeahh
23/9/17, 22:36:04: Bozheng: Hmm looks like I've never been able to do that
23/9/17, 22:36:05: Wan Xi: But does it make the tea seem to taste nicer?
23/9/17, 22:36:28: Bozheng: Actually not really. But it goes really well with mooncakes
23/9/17, 22:36:36: Wan Xi: ;-;
23/9/17, 22:36:39: Wan Xi: We need to
23/9/17, 22:36:42: Wan Xi: Kick this habit
23/9/17, 22:36:47: Wan Xi: Of talking about food at night
23/9/17, 22:36:49: Wan Xi: I cannot
23/9/17, 22:36:56: Wan Xi: Omg i legit get very hungry
23/9/17, 22:37:06: Wan Xi: ;-;
23/9/17, 22:37:31: Wan Xi: OKAY
23/9/17, 22:37:38: Wan Xi: SETTLED I AM GONNA GET MOONCAKES
23/9/17, 22:37:43: Wan Xi: Where to buyyy
23/9/17, 22:37:45: Wan Xi: :o
23/9/17, 22:37:53: Wan Xi: Thanks for cancelling out the moon
23/9/17, 22:37:56: Wan Xi: Very helpful
23/9/17, 22:37:59: Wan Xi: 😒
23/9/17, 22:38:28: Bozheng: Most mooncakes are quite expensive. Im not sure where you can get than for a good value
23/9/17, 22:38:51: Bozheng: If you go there and bake a cake, it's technically a _mooncake_
23/9/17, 22:39:27: Wan Xi: I jist asked my dad to help me buy mooncake
23/9/17, 22:39:33: Wan Xi: You know whay he said? :c
23/9/17, 22:39:54: Bozheng: What did he say
23/9/17, 22:39:59: Wan Xi: Technically it's a wan xi cake
23/9/17, 22:40:13: Wan Xi: Pm lee was talking about diabetes....
23/9/17, 22:40:21: Wan Xi: T.T
23/9/17, 22:40:41: Wan Xi: Made with extra care and love HAHAHA
23/9/17, 22:40:53: Bozheng: That made me laugh
23/9/17, 22:40:56: Wan Xi: Oh but the idea of baking a cake on the moon is really interesting
23/9/17, 22:41:15: Wan Xi: Because the atmospheric conditions are very different
23/9/17, 22:41:21: Wan Xi: Will the cake rise more
23/9/17, 22:41:25: Wan Xi: Because of the weaker gravity
23/9/17, 22:41:52: Wan Xi: And if that's the case
23/9/17, 22:41:57: Wan Xi: Will it taste more bland
23/9/17, 22:42:04: Wan Xi: Because even though it tskes up more space
23/9/17, 22:42:18: Bozheng: Wow your inner scientist is coming out
23/9/17, 22:42:21: Wan Xi: There are lesser air molecules in the pockets
23/9/17, 22:42:34: Wan Xi: No it isnttt
23/9/17, 22:42:42: Wan Xi: The sleepy me still predominates hoho
23/9/17, 22:42:50: Wan Xi: :(
23/9/17, 22:43:01: Wan Xi: Hey it's not funny for me :(
23/9/17, 22:43:18: Wan Xi: 我要吃月饼;-;
23/9/17, 22:43:21: Bozheng: That's an interesting proposition. Maybe you should get NASA funding to send you there to try it out
23/9/17, 22:43:28: Wan Xi: HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAA
23/9/17, 22:43:59: Bozheng: "Daddy, 我要吃月饼!"
23/9/17, 22:44:42: Bozheng: Ok but if you really want you can try out some of the neighbourhood celebrations they should offer some mooncakes
23/9/17, 22:45:16: Wan Xi: Interesting fact, people have begun to synthesis and crystallise drugs in space, because apparently the structure forms better with weaker gravity

23/9/17, 22:49:15: Bozheng: I think the CCs have it? I'm not too sure cuz i have never attended one in the past
23/9/17, 22:49:28: Wan Xi: Dont put on extra guard against your future daughters (if you plan on having any kids that is)

23/9/17, 22:50:55: Wan Xi: Hold up lemme save that day
23/9/17, 22:51:38: Bozheng: If you are lucky you will get to sit under the moonlight, sipping hot tea while savouring every bite of that delicious mooncake
23/9/17, 22:52:38: Wan Xi: umm
23/9/17, 22:52:41: Wan Xi: moonlight in sg
23/9/17, 22:52:43: Wan Xi: a bit

23/9/17, 22:52:48: Wan Xi: a bit...
23/9/17, 22:52:52: Wan Xi: not very nice uh
23/9/17, 22:52:53: Wan Xi: HAHA
23/9/17, 22:53:07: Bozheng: Oh yea i just remembered something
23/9/17, 22:53:11: Wan Xi: you didnt hear this from me
23/9/17, 22:53:14: Wan Xi: 🌚🌚🌚
23/9/17, 22:53:19: Wan Xi: 🏙
23/9/17, 22:53:53: Bozheng: Remember i was telling you about  the binoculars a few days ago?
23/9/17, 22:54:04: Wan Xi: uh huhh
23/9/17, 22:54:21: Bozheng: I think i tried to stare into the moon with that thing on a full moon day
23/9/17, 22:54:28: Bozheng: Wasn't very successful
23/9/17, 22:54:42: Bozheng: Was hoping the see craters and the beautiful complexion of the moon
23/9/17, 22:55:16: Bozheng: Turned out it was just a blur of white with nothing
23/9/17, 22:55:49: Wan Xi: :o
23/9/17, 22:55:56: Wan Xi: you use binoculars to stare at the moon?
23/9/17, 22:56:11: Wan Xi: would a telescope be more appropriate
23/9/17, 22:56:16: Wan Xi: binoculars...
23/9/17, 22:56:26: Wan Xi: o.o
23/9/17, 22:56:48: Wan Xi: i think the focal length doesnt allow you to observe the craters right
23/9/17, 22:56:48: Wan Xi: o.o
23/9/17, 22:56:56: Bozheng: You just reminded me. I had a telescope for my 10th or 11th birthday. It's still sleeping in my cupboard till this day
23/9/17, 22:57:22: Wan Xi: believe it or not, scientists look at these blur of whites with nothing and see something out of it
23/9/17, 22:57:25: Wan Xi: xD
23/9/17, 22:57:42: Wan Xi: use it!!!
23/9/17, 22:57:51: Wan Xi: youre lucky you dont have specs
23/9/17, 22:57:52: Wan Xi: :(
23/9/17, 22:58:04: Wan Xi: using equipment like these is a pain
23/9/17, 22:58:08: Bozheng: Let me try find it. I might have given it out as another birthday present to someone else
23/9/17, 22:58:14: Wan Xi: are*

23/9/17, 23:04:56: Bozheng: <‎image omitted>
23/9/17, 23:04:59: Wan Xi: they had these telescopes that you could use if you paid a small amount of $$
23/9/17, 23:05:18: Wan Xi: i think i broke it or something it worked without me having to pay hehe
23/9/17, 23:05:50: Bozheng: Probably someone already broke it
23/9/17, 23:06:14: Bozheng: And no one knew, or those who knew kept quiet
23/9/17, 23:06:19: Wan Xi: but my bro used it before me
23/9/17, 23:06:21: Wan Xi: and he had to pay
23/9/17, 23:06:28: Wan Xi: and yes i may have whacked it
23/9/17, 23:06:32: Wan Xi: 🌚
23/9/17, 23:06:34: Wan Xi: accidentally
23/9/17, 23:06:36: Wan Xi: but hey

23/9/17, 23:06:51: Wan Xi: no one knows
23/9/17, 23:06:55: Wan Xi: 🌚🌚
23/9/17, 23:07:04: Bozheng: At least you got to enjoy it for free. Which was nice
23/9/17, 23:07:12: Bozheng: Well now I know
23/9/17, 23:07:26: Wan Xi: okay ive never used that kind of telescope before
23/9/17, 23:07:31: Wan Xi: have you even tried it out
23/9/17, 23:07:33: Wan Xi: it looks new
23/9/17, 23:07:34: Wan Xi: o.o
23/9/17, 23:07:40: Bozheng: I don't think so
23/9/17, 23:07:45: Wan Xi: HAHA
23/9/17, 23:07:52: Wan Xi: time to put it to the test
23/9/17, 23:08:01: Wan Xi: after 6yrs of disusage
23/9/17, 23:08:03: Bozheng: Maybe once, but gave up after a minute or so
23/9/17, 23:08:18: Wan Xi: ..... i should prolly stop loading you up with blackmail material
23/9/17, 23:08:25: Wan Xi: :[
23/9/17, 23:08:30: Wan Xi: ive got none on you
23/9/17, 23:08:37: Wan Xi: except for the bitcoin farming one hoho
23/9/17, 23:08:39: Wan Xi: :3
23/9/17, 23:08:48: Wan Xi: but that one is more for fishing out jiwon HAHA
23/9/17, 23:09:02: Bozheng: Jiwon?
23/9/17, 23:09:15: Wan Xi: tsk what is this level of persistence
23/9/17, 23:09:18: Wan Xi: determination
23/9/17, 23:09:22: Wan Xi: perseverance
23/9/17, 23:09:30: Bozheng: That was 7 years ago
23/9/17, 23:09:31: Wan Xi: wasnt it jiwon
23/9/17, 23:09:39: Wan Xi: whom you had that discussion with
23/9/17, 23:09:40: Wan Xi: :o
23/9/17, 23:09:49: Bozheng: I don't think so
23/9/17, 23:09:50: Wan Xi: were you not you 7 yrs ago
23/9/17, 23:09:53: Wan Xi: o.o
23/9/17, 23:09:56: Wan Xi: okay then
23/9/17, 23:09:59: Bozheng: Maybe both Enric and him
23/9/17, 23:10:06: Wan Xi: :P
23/9/17, 23:10:09: Wan Xi: hehehehehehehhehee
23/9/17, 23:10:17: Bozheng: Our identities change every second
23/9/17, 23:10:26: Wan Xi: does it?
23/9/17, 23:10:32: Bozheng: The moment you inhale oxygen
23/9/17, 23:10:40: Bozheng: The chemical composition of your body changes
23/9/17, 23:10:39: Wan Xi: wow that is deep
23/9/17, 23:10:55: Wan Xi: okay..  i was not expecting this
23/9/17, 23:11:45: Wan Xi: _technically_, in scientific studies the change in composition is so small relative to your overall body composition that it's taken to be _negligible_
23/9/17, 23:12:09: Wan Xi: esp stuff relating to respiration
23/9/17, 23:12:21: Wan Xi: unless youre talking about hazardous chemicals
23/9/17, 23:12:28: Wan Xi: like poisonous metals :o
23/9/17, 23:12:37: Wan Xi: which can kill even in tiny doses
23/9/17, 23:12:40: Wan Xi: ALSO
23/9/17, 23:12:49: Wan Xi: DOES IT RLY AFFECT YOU _IDENTITY_
23/9/17, 23:12:52: Wan Xi: your*

24/9/17, 21:56:20: Bozheng: Snow skin? Is it the cold one?
24/9/17, 21:56:29: Wan Xi: um
24/9/17, 21:56:40: Wan Xi: isnt cold dependent on other factors...
24/9/17, 21:56:50: Wan Xi: rather than the type of mooncake
24/9/17, 21:56:54: Bozheng: That's how you got mooncake. Where did he get it from though?
24/9/17, 21:56:56: Wan Xi: other*
24/9/17, 21:57:15: Wan Xi: sheng siong probably?
24/9/17, 21:57:26: Wan Xi: why :o
24/9/17, 21:57:39: Wan Xi: DONT COMPARE QUALITY OF MOONCAKES OR WHATEVER
24/9/17, 21:57:44: Wan Xi: IM NOT HAVING THAT
24/9/17, 21:57:55: Bozheng: Hmm

24/9/17, 22:00:08: Wan Xi: ((keep this up and maybe we can come up with a melody for a song))
24/9/17, 22:00:19: Wan Xi: then maybe i'll get inspiration for some song writing
24/9/17, 22:00:35: Wan Xi: and then maybe  i can audition for musicfest next yr or smth
24/9/17, 22:00:36: Wan Xi: :D
24/9/17, 22:01:05: Wan Xi: nawhhh

Actually I've seen people make german beatbox with Google translate
24/9/17, 22:01:34: Wan Xi: amongst the city lights with the cramped up vicinity
24/9/17, 22:01:54: Wan Xi: please i sing songs using chinese compre passages
24/9/17, 22:02:03: Wan Xi: and that says a lot coming from me

24/9/17, 22:03:02: Bozheng: First line:

阅读理解B （24分）
24/9/17, 22:03:15: Bozheng: I wonder how you would sing that
24/9/17, 22:03:20: Wan Xi: Under the moonlight with a cup of chinese tea?
nawh, amongst the city lights with the cramped up vicinity
24/9/17, 22:03:39: Bozheng: There's no moon?
24/9/17, 22:04:07: Wan Xi: is that a challenge? :3
24/9/17, 22:04:19: Wan Xi: cant see it form my room
24/9/17, 22:04:20: Wan Xi: :(
24/9/17, 22:04:22: Wan Xi: :((((
24/9/17, 22:04:24: Wan Xi: from*
24/9/17, 22:04:57: Bozheng: Well you can sing it to me tomorrow
24/9/17, 22:05:06: Bozheng: Wait you are already recording an audio
24/9/17, 22:05:08: Wan Xi: hmmmm
24/9/17, 22:05:10: Wan Xi: HAHAHAHAHHAHA
24/9/17, 22:05:19: Wan Xi: <‎audio omitted>
24/9/17, 22:05:39: Bozheng: You have the talent for singing
24/9/17, 22:05:52: Bozheng: This is next level resourcefulness
24/9/17, 22:05:59: Bozheng: Anything can be turned into a song
24/9/17, 22:06:13: Wan Xi: heheheh awwww im flattered :3
24/9/17, 22:06:19: Wan Xi: welll
24/9/17, 22:06:35: Wan Xi: when im bored i also try to sing product descriptions of body shampoos and whatnot
24/9/17, 22:06:37: Wan Xi: HAHA
24/9/17, 22:06:53: Bozheng: Please don't tell me you sing the ingredients of body soap
24/9/17, 22:07:08: Wan Xi: do i? 🌚🌚
24/9/17, 22:07:11: Bozheng: Imagining making all those chemical names into songs
24/9/17, 22:07:47: Wan Xi: but of course
24/9/17, 22:08:07: Wan Xi: the words dont really seem to retain their intended message or meaning that well
24/9/17, 22:08:15: Wan Xi: erhhh
24/9/17, 22:08:32: Bozheng: That will be very funny to hear
24/9/17, 22:08:37: Wan Xi: because the tone and voice emphasis on the words are very different
24/9/17, 22:08:50: Bozheng: All those words turned into a melody
24/9/17, 22:09:26: Bozheng: That's true

Imagine saying soDIUM instead of SOdium
24/9/17, 22:09:50: Bozheng: Try it you will sound weird
24/9/17, 22:10:06: Wan Xi: ehhh
24/9/17, 22:10:11: Wan Xi: challenge accepted
24/9/17, 22:10:11: Wan Xi: HAHA

24/9/17, 22:11:11: Wan Xi: what do you mean? :o
24/9/17, 22:11:15: Bozheng: I ended up playing with them
24/9/17, 22:11:26: Bozheng: <‎image omitted>
24/9/17, 22:11:37: Bozheng: You can set a different alert tone for different people
24/9/17, 22:12:21: Bozheng: Not sure if it's available for Android
24/9/17, 22:12:28: Wan Xi: Hmmmmm

30/9/17, 17:21:33: Wan Xi: Not that great at multitasking heh
30/9/17, 17:22:03: Bozheng: Cheng san public library
30/9/17, 17:22:09: Bozheng: Where is it
30/9/17, 17:22:32: Wan Xi: My house
30/9/17, 17:22:35: Wan Xi: 🌚
30/9/17, 17:23:30: Bozheng: That means your house must be where knowledge concentrate
30/9/17, 17:23:57: Bozheng: Were you there the whole day
30/9/17, 17:24:10: Wan Xi: Of courseeee
30/9/17, 17:24:15: Wan Xi: My house has internet access
30/9/17, 17:24:20: Wan Xi: That's all you need really
30/9/17, 17:24:29: Wan Xi: Oh and working computers
30/9/17, 17:24:35: Wan Xi: That are up to date
30/9/17, 17:24:47: Wan Xi: Haha it's a library in hougang
30/9/17, 17:24:55: Wan Xi: Nopee
30/9/17, 17:25:04: Wan Xi: I actually came out to gym with a friend
30/9/17, 17:25:16: Wan Xi: But then i got too sleepy and couldnt go home
30/9/17, 17:25:32: Wan Xi: So my friend brought me to someplace to sleep....  heh heh heh
30/9/17, 17:25:42: Bozheng: I see
30/9/17, 17:25:49: Bozheng: So not only is the library your house
30/9/17, 17:25:58: Bozheng: It's also your bedroom
30/9/17, 17:26:11: Bozheng: It must have been really cozy
30/9/17, 17:26:13: Wan Xi: Why restrict myself to such a small place
30/9/17, 17:26:21: Wan Xi: Why have the library as my bedroom
30/9/17, 17:26:32: Wan Xi: When the whole world is my playground
30/9/17, 17:28:21: Bozheng: "Google Earth"
30/9/17, 17:28:37: Bozheng: Spin the globe around like there's no tomorrow
30/9/17, 17:28:53: Bozheng: Anyway I need to go out, so I'll talk to you later
30/9/17, 17:32:22: Wan Xi: HAHAHAHHHAH THANKS FOR BRINGING ME BACK DOWN TO REALITY
30/9/17, 17:32:25: Wan Xi: 😂😂😂
30/9/17, 17:33:34: Wan Xi: Maybe if you find a way to do that fast enough, we could ruin the planetary orbits of our solar system and create enough momentum to spark a fourth dimension
30/9/17, 17:33:52: Wan Xi: On the surface of the earth
30/9/17, 17:34:43: Wan Xi: Wait actually it's more likely you'll set the entire earth on fire
30/9/17, 17:34:57: Wan Xi: But then again most of the earth's surface is water
30/9/17, 17:35:00: Wan Xi: BUT THEN AGAIN
30/9/17, 17:35:23: Wan Xi: Nvm let's not think about this
30/9/17, 17:35:25: Wan Xi: 🌚
30/9/17, 17:36:00: Wan Xi: See youuu
30/9/17, 18:17:50: Bozheng: Not sure if salt water can extinguish fire
30/9/17, 18:18:48: Bozheng: If we spin it too fast
30/9/17, 18:18:57: Bozheng: We might have a great red spot on Earth
30/9/17, 19:52:34: Wan Xi: I think it can :o
30/9/17, 19:52:43: Wan Xi: But because of the friction between the air and the earth
30/9/17, 19:52:58: Wan Xi: The atmosphere would be superheated to very high temperatures
30/9/17, 19:54:24: Wan Xi: Ahahahha talk later
30/9/17, 22:19:41: Bozheng: Hello
30/9/17, 22:19:47: Bozheng: I just got home
30/9/17, 22:20:20: Bozheng: Was at an event at 福州会馆

1/10/17, 09:26:52: Wan Xi: HAHAHA WHATEVER HAPPENED TO CONTROLLING YOUR EATING?
1/10/17, 10:16:03: Bozheng: Good food /= a lot of food
1/10/17, 10:16:16: Bozheng: Near people's association
1/10/17, 10:17:27: Bozheng: The food was very authentic
1/10/17, 10:17:40: Bozheng: It's the kind you'll either get in Fuzhou or in that place
1/10/17, 10:17:48: Bozheng: Can't find anywhere else
1/10/17, 12:16:41: Wan Xi: True true

1/10/17, 12:17:05: Wan Xi: 🌚
1/10/17, 12:17:29: Wan Xi: How does food become "authentic"?
1/10/17, 14:14:50: Bozheng: Are you feeling better now
1/10/17, 14:15:36: Bozheng: As in the food resembles a lot to the original food from its place of origin
1/10/17, 14:28:27: Wan Xi: of courseeeee
1/10/17, 14:28:29: Wan Xi: it's raining

1/10/17, 16:17:36: Bozheng: Before we were fed

14/10/17, 10:32:10: Wan Xi: You know
14/10/17, 10:32:22: Wan Xi: Going by elimination when it coems to universities is...
14/10/17, 10:32:31: Wan Xi: Not exactly the most recommended way
14/10/17, 10:32:46: Bozheng: Really? It's my favourite way of doing things
14/10/17, 10:32:55: Bozheng: A lot of my decisions are made by elimination
14/10/17, 10:33:10: Bozheng: Especially MCQ exam qns
14/10/17, 10:36:31: Wan Xi: Do you eliminate people as well?
14/10/17, 10:42:33: Wan Xi: Not like
14/10/17, 10:42:36: Wan Xi: Im a tricky way
14/10/17, 10:42:38: Wan Xi: Just that
14/10/17, 10:42:42: Wan Xi: I was thinking about ur wr
14/10/17, 10:43:09: Wan Xi: Cos like normally elimination involves working within what you have
14/10/17, 10:43:25: Wan Xi: But wouldnt it be very good to consider expanding tjose options?
14/10/17, 10:53:28: Bozheng: That's true
14/10/17, 10:53:35: Bozheng: More options more to eliminate
14/10/17, 10:53:39: Bozheng: Can mKe a better choice
14/10/17, 10:53:49: Bozheng: Hmm what do you mean?

23/10/17, 15:12:06: Bozheng: I was cycling and my bike broke down along Mandai road
23/10/17, 15:12:47: Bozheng: One of the worst place for the bike to fail, no civilisation for many kilometers on either direction
23/10/17, 15:20:09: Wan Xi: Wow
23/10/17, 15:20:14: Wan Xi: That felt like a diary entry
23/10/17, 15:20:24: Wan Xi: Very unfortjnate indeed :/
23/10/17, 15:20:58: Wan Xi: So... you walked back?

23/10/17, 15:21:38: Bozheng: Thankfully my dad has a bike rack on his car
23/10/17, 15:21:45: Bozheng: So i just called him

23/10/17, 15:49:45: Wan Xi: So you just waited by the roadside for 30mins or so?
23/10/17, 15:49:47: Bozheng: So you had wished i walked 4 hours home
23/10/17, 15:49:48: Wan Xi: No exploring?

27/10/17, 22:25:16: Wan Xi: which is why
27/10/17, 22:25:18: Wan Xi: medical school
27/10/17, 22:25:24: Wan Xi: is so painfully hard
27/10/17, 22:25:53: Bozheng: Imagine saying, john moves his deltoid region to the right, catches the ball with his (medical term for hand), and skillfully throw it back
27/10/17, 22:26:09: Wan Xi: erhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
27/10/17, 22:26:14: Wan Xi: btw

27/10/17, 22:26:55: Bozheng: Good that they dont complicate stuff
27/10/17, 22:27:00: Wan Xi: also i dont think you use deltoid region like that
27/10/17, 22:27:01: Wan Xi: HAHAHHAHAHA
27/10/17, 22:27:05: Wan Xi: it's like
27/10/17, 22:27:09: Wan Xi: for reference purposes
27/10/17, 22:27:27: Wan Xi: to direct other people's attention, like say nurses or other doctors you are working with to focus on that area
27/10/17, 22:27:33: Wan Xi: not so much of move it
27/10/17, 22:27:50: Wan Xi: :3
27/10/17, 22:27:54: Wan Xi: pretty much
27/10/17, 22:28:04: Bozheng: Touché
27/10/17, 22:28:12: Wan Xi: "shoulder" is still a very relevant term to doctors
27/10/17, 22:28:25: Wan Xi: what does this mean? :o

6/11/17, 11:59:52: Wan Xi: What??
6/11/17, 11:59:54: Wan Xi: Good genes?
6/11/17, 11:59:58: Wan Xi: How is that related o.o
6/11/17, 12:14:14: Bozheng: Isnt the ability to sleep partly determined by our genes(or at least it's hereditary?)
6/11/17, 12:14:31: Bozheng: Enlighten me with your inner scientist
6/11/17, 13:28:42: Wan Xi: What
6/11/17, 13:28:44: Wan Xi: It is?
6/11/17, 13:28:46: Wan Xi: I never knew that
6/11/17, 13:29:11: Wan Xi: I always thought it was due to physical factors
6/11/17, 13:29:14: Wan Xi: Like environment
6/11/17, 13:29:17: Wan Xi: Lifestyle
6/11/17, 13:29:21: Wan Xi: Age

6/11/17, 16:50:25: Bozheng: 30 mins nap, even on school days?
6/11/17, 16:51:10: Wan Xi: Sometimes
6/11/17, 16:51:16: Bozheng: So how successful have you been?
6/11/17, 16:51:27: Bozheng: Found alternatives? Like tea?
6/11/17, 16:51:35: Wan Xi: Ive never had more than 1 sip of coffee in my life
6/11/17, 16:51:56: Wan Xi: Like id nap on the table, at the sick bay, or on the library couch hehe
6/11/17, 16:52:17: Wan Xi: 1 sip cos today i got a wrong order, the person gave me coffee instead of milk tea
6/11/17, 16:52:30: Wan Xi: Coffee tastes horrible ;-;
6/11/17, 16:52:48: Wan Xi: It wasnt even bitter
6/11/17, 16:52:54: Wan Xi: I just dont like it HAHA
6/11/17, 16:53:24: Bozheng: The black coffee with no sugar and cream does
6/11/17, 16:53:41: Wan Xi: Any coffee
6/11/17, 16:53:45: Wan Xi: In my opinion
6/11/17, 16:53:46: Wan Xi: Tastes bad

6/11/17, 17:00:09: Bozheng: When we are near the end of the numbering
6/11/17, 17:00:12: Bozheng: Then we realise
6/11/17, 17:00:19: Bozheng: Then we say forget it
6/11/17, 17:00:33: Bozheng: Let's just submit a copy that starts from page zero instead of one

17/11/17, 15:16:42: Bozheng: Can be bought directly from the fishing village
17/11/17, 15:16:55: Wan Xi: Do you get to catch it urself? :3
17/11/17, 15:17:21: Bozheng: Unless you want your hand to be cut by the crab
17/11/17, 15:17:27: Bozheng: No lah you buy it from the fisherman
17/11/17, 15:17:34: Wan Xi: Tsk
17/11/17, 15:17:44: Wan Xi: That's just cos you no skill :3
17/11/17, 15:18:01: Bozheng: That's probably true
17/11/17, 15:18:18: Bozheng: I was in JB to fish with a group of friends two yrs ago
17/11/17, 15:18:29: Bozheng: Everyone caught a fish except for me and another person
17/11/17, 15:18:44: Wan Xi: W8uh
17/11/17, 15:18:47: Wan Xi: Brb
17/11/17, 15:19:29: Wan Xi: I went shipping idk how long ago
17/11/17, 15:19:34: Wan Xi: I think2 yrs ago also
17/11/17, 15:19:47: Wan Xi: Nobody caught a fish except for me and another person
17/11/17, 15:19:51: Wan Xi: Fishing*
17/11/17, 15:19:56: Wan Xi: But i caught 2 fishes
17/11/17, 15:19:57: Wan Xi: HAHAHAHAHHAHAHAH
17/11/17, 15:20:03: Bozheng: Wah
17/11/17, 15:20:17: Bozheng: Not bad, just the inverted situation
17/11/17, 15:20:17: Wan Xi: :3
17/11/17, 15:20:18: Wan Xi: :3
17/11/17, 15:20:20: Wan Xi: :3
17/11/17, 15:20:42: Wan Xi: Yeah... other than that i dont think ive rly gone fishing before?
17/11/17, 15:20:43: Wan Xi: o.o
17/11/17, 15:20:49: Wan Xi: With line and rod that is
17/11/17, 15:20:55: Bozheng: It was my first time also
17/11/17, 15:21:05: Bozheng: The fish always slip back into the pond
17/11/17, 15:21:16: Wan Xi: OK BRB
17/11/17, 15:25:46: Wan Xi: You caught em using hook and line?
17/11/17, 15:25:55: Wan Xi: Ooofff this reminds me of a really good story
17/11/17, 15:28:39: Wan Xi: But meh
17/11/17, 15:28:46: Wan Xi: These days if you ask me to go fishing
17/11/17, 15:28:50: Wan Xi: I wouldnt bother really
17/11/17, 15:29:03: Wan Xi: Im totally on for electrofishing
17/11/17, 15:29:06: Wan Xi: Sooooo much better
17/11/17, 15:37:41: Bozheng: Electrofishing? Fish by electrocuting them?
17/11/17, 15:38:48: Bozheng: Sounds like a way to catch a large number of fish in a short amount of time
17/11/17, 15:39:26: Wan Xi: No
17/11/17, 15:39:56: Wan Xi: By putting 2 electric pulse generators at two different parts of the water
17/11/17, 15:40:19: Wan Xi: They transmit the an electric current to each other
17/11/17, 15:40:34: Wan Xi: That i think interferes with the nervous system of the fishes
17/11/17, 15:40:39: Wan Xi: Causing them to swim to one end
17/11/17, 15:40:50: Wan Xi: Smth like ions moving twds and electrode
17/11/17, 15:41:01: Bozheng: Wah that's smart
17/11/17, 15:41:07: Wan Xi: Then you can just take a net and grab the fish
17/11/17, 15:41:08: Wan Xi: LOL
17/11/17, 15:41:12: Bozheng: A scientist's way of catching fish
17/11/17, 15:41:22: Wan Xi: It is a scientific way of samplig fish
17/11/17, 15:41:26: Wan Xi: Cos it doesn hurt the fish
17/11/17, 15:41:28: Wan Xi: LOL
17/11/17, 15:41:38: Wan Xi: So you can study them
17/11/17, 15:41:49: Wan Xi: Ofc we can eat them later, but study them :3
17/11/17, 15:41:52: Wan Xi: :3
17/11/17, 15:42:08: Bozheng: Study first, but eating is always important
17/11/17, 15:42:23: Bozheng: Looks like the polar opposite of electrocuting fish
17/11/17, 15:42:36: Bozheng: I might be a little too cruel
17/11/17, 15:43:01: Wan Xi: You?
17/11/17, 15:43:03: Wan Xi: Ya lorh
17/11/17, 15:43:04: Wan Xi: You cruel
17/11/17, 15:43:06: Wan Xi: 😒
17/11/17, 15:43:27: Wan Xi: HAHAHAHHA
17/11/17, 15:43:33: Wan Xi: I dont understand this
17/11/17, 15:43:56: Wan Xi: There's also dynamite fishing
17/11/17, 15:44:05: Bozheng: Oh that
17/11/17, 15:44:08: Wan Xi: Oh that one is fun
17/11/17, 15:44:14: Bozheng: *returns to sec sch geog"
17/11/17, 15:44:23: Wan Xi: And another one is swoop net fishing(?)
17/11/17, 15:44:28: Wan Xi: Idk the exact name
17/11/17, 15:44:29: Wan Xi: Lol
17/11/17, 15:44:41: Wan Xi: But what happens is that they have a giant net
17/11/17, 15:44:53: Wan Xi: And some bubble blowing mechanism
17/11/17, 15:45:06: Wan Xi: So you blow bubbles at the ocean floor

17/11/17, 15:45:38: Wan Xi: ((If you can even imagine))
17/11/17, 15:45:55: Bozheng: Should be pretty effective for fishes playing hide and seek
